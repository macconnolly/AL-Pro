# YAML Migration Completion Report

## Overview
Implementation_1’s 3,000+ lines of helpers have been replaced by the Adaptive Lighting Pro integration plus the slimmer `implementation_2.yaml` companion. This document records the final parity audit so future contributors can confirm nothing regressed after the migration.

## Integration Coverage
- **Zones & Manual Overrides** – Runtime-driven timers, asymmetric boundaries, per-zone multipliers, and global pause logic supersede the YAML timers and booleans.
- **Environmental & Sunset Boosts** – Lux/weather/sun observers in `features/environmental.py` now deliver positive-only boosts with per-zone gating and adaptive-mode awareness.
- **Modes & Scenes** – Configurable modes and four household scenes (Full Bright, No Spots, Evening Comfort, Ultra Dim) include manual timers, offset persistence, and reset affordances.
- **Controllers & Sunrise** – Zen32 handling, Sonos alarm anchoring, skip-next service, and watchdog/nightly sweep schedules cover the automation-heavy routines from the YAML file.
- **Observability** – Health score, analytics summary, manual action sensors, and rate-limit telemetry expose the runtime state that YAML sensors previously modeled.

## Companion Package Coverage
- **Scene & Adjustment Scripts** – `implementation_2.yaml` wraps public services for scene selection, manual adjustments, zone resets, and backup/restore actions to keep Lovelace dashboards and voice assistants simple.
- **Lifestyle Automations** – Startup restore, movie-mode bridge/reset, sunset nudges, manual recovery, nightly backups, rate-limit notifications, skip-next toggles, and global pause resync mirror the daily-life glue from Implementation_1.
- **Helper Entities** – Required light groups (`group.all_lights`, `group.no_spots`) and the dashboard-friendly backup button provide parity with the original helper entities.

## Verification
- **Unit Tests** – `tests/test_adjust_and_scenes.py` and `tests/test_service_api_parity.py` prove that all scenes, manual timers, and service APIs behave as expected, including reset/enable/disable and backup/restore operations.
- **Scenario Traces** – `docs/SCENARIO_VALIDATION.md` tracks end-to-end flows (manual overrides, environmental boosts, scenes, sunrise coordination, service parity) with file and line references.
- **Companion Audit** – `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_2_PLAN.md` lists every legacy capability, how it is handled now, and remaining future enhancements (e.g., upcoming Sonos anchor sensor exposure).

## Result
The combination of the integration and `implementation_2.yaml` fully replaces `implementation_1.yaml` while adding resilience, observability, and user-facing conveniences. Any future changes should update this report to keep migration status transparent.
