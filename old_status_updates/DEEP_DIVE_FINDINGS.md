## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Before Production)

### ISSUE #1: Wake Sequence Bypassed by Manual Control 🚨

**Severity**: HIGH - Defeats primary morning wake-up feature
**File**: `coordinator.py` lines 350-356, 432-434

**Problem Description**:
Wake sequence boost is calculated INSIDE `_apply_adjustments_to_zone()`, which is SKIPPED when manual control is active. If user touches lights before alarm, wake sequence is completely cancelled.

**Real-World Scenario**:
```
5:55 AM: I wake up early, turn on bedroom lights (100% bright)
         → Manual control timer starts (2 hours)
6:15 AM: Wake sequence should start (gradual 15-min ramp)
         → SKIPPED because manual control flag is active
6:30 AM: Alarm fires, no gradual wake experience
```

**Root Cause**:
```python
# coordinator.py:350
if not self.zone_manager.is_manual_control_active(zone_id):
    await self._apply_adjustments_to_zone(zone_id, zone_config)  # Wake boost is in here!
else:
    _LOGGER.debug("Skipping adjustment for zone %s (manual control active)", zone_id)
```

**Impact**: Complete loss of wake sequence feature if lights are touched before alarm

**Proposed Fix**:
```python
# Option A: Wake sequence should OVERRIDE manual control during its window
if self._wake_sequence.is_in_active_window(zone_id):
    wake_boost = self._wake_sequence.calculate_boost(zone_id)
    # Apply wake boost even if manual control active
elif not self.zone_manager.is_manual_control_active(zone_id):
    await self._apply_adjustments_to_zone(zone_id, zone_config)

# Option B: Wake sequence only affects lights that are OFF
# (More complex - requires light state checking)
```

**Test Coverage**: Wake sequence tests pass, but don't test manual control conflict
**User Workaround**: None - user can't avoid this if they wake early

---

### ISSUE #2: Button vs Slider Timer Inconsistency 🚨

**Severity**: MEDIUM - Confusing UX, unexpected behavior
**File**: `coordinator.py` lines 963-1029, `platforms/button.py`, `platforms/number.py`

**Problem Description**:
Buttons start 2-hour timers (temporary overrides), but sliders don't (persistent preferences). This creates two different mental models for the same adjustment type.

**Real-World Scenarios**:

**Scenario A - Button Workflow**:
```
7:00 PM: Press "Dimmer" button 3 times → -45% total
         Each press starts/restarts 2-hour timer
9:00 PM: Timer expires
         → Lights suddenly get brighter (adjustment cleared to 0%)
         → USER CONFUSED: "I wanted them dimmed!"
```

**Scenario B - Slider Workflow**:
```
7:00 PM: Drag brightness slider to -45%
         NO timer started
Next morning 7:00 AM: Lights still at -45%
         → USER CONFUSED: "Why are my morning lights so dim?"
```

**Root Cause**:
```python
# Buttons call with start_timers=True
await coordinator.set_brightness_adjustment(value, start_timers=True)

# Sliders call with start_timers=False
await coordinator.set_brightness_adjustment(value, start_timers=False)
```

**Impact**: Users can't predict when adjustments will expire

**Proposed Fix**:
```python
# Option A: ALL adjustments should have timers (consistency)
# - Simpler mental model: "Everything expires after 2 hours"

# Option B: Add "lock" toggle to UI
# - Button: Temporary (with lock icon to make persistent)
# - Slider: Shows countdown timer with option to make persistent

# Option C: Smart timeout based on time of day (implementation_1.yaml had this!)
# - Nighttime (10 PM - 6 AM): 1.5x timeout (3 hours)
# - Daytime: 1.0x timeout (2 hours)
# - This way evening adjustments last through bedtime
```

**Test Coverage**: Timer tests pass, but don't validate user expectations
**User Workaround**: Use slider for persistent, button for temporary (but undocumented)

### ISSUE #3: Environmental Time Multiplier Uses Clock Time, Not Sun Elevation 🚨

**Severity**: MEDIUM - Winter mornings get insufficient boost
**File**: `features/environmental.py` lines 160-161, time multiplier calculation

**Problem Description**:
Environmental boost uses clock time (6-8 AM = dawn with 0.7x multiplier), but in winter 6-8 AM is still dark and needs FULL boost, not reduced.

**Real-World Scenario**:
```
Winter Morning - December 21st, 6:30 AM
Sun rises at 7:15 AM (still 45 minutes of darkness)

Current lux: 15 (very dark)
Lux boost: 15% (< 10 lux threshold)
Weather: Cloudy → +10%
Season: Winter → +8%
RAW boost: 33%

Time multiplier at 6:30 AM: 0.7x (dawn reduction)
FINAL boost: 33% × 0.7 = 23%

PROBLEM: Lost 10% of needed boost because clock says "dawn" but sun hasn't risen!
```

**Root Cause**:
Time multiplier hardcoded to clock hours, not sun position:
```python
ENV_REDUCED_HOURS = [(6, 8), (18, 22)]  # Morning and evening
ENV_REDUCED_MULTIPLIER = 0.7  # 70% during reduced hours
```

**Impact**: Dark winter mornings get 30% less boost than needed

**Proposed Fix**:
```python
# Use sun elevation instead of clock time
def _calculate_time_multiplier(self) -> float:
    sun_state = self.hass.states.get("sun.sun")
    if not sun_state:
        return 1.0  # Fallback to full boost

    elevation = sun_state.attributes.get("elevation", 0)

    if elevation < -6:  # Civil twilight - still night
        return 0.0  # No boost needed at night
    elif -6 <= elevation < 0:  # Actual dawn/dusk
        return 0.7  # Reduce during twilight
    else:  # Daytime
        return 1.0  # Full boost
```

**Test Coverage**: Environmental tests pass, but use fixed clock times
**User Workaround**: Manually increase brightness during dark winter mornings

---

### ISSUE #4: Sunset Boost Missing Warmth Component 🚨

**Severity**: MEDIUM - Defeats "golden hour" aesthetic
**File**: `features/sunset_boost.py`, `coordinator.py` line 465

**Problem Description**:
Sunset boost only affects BRIGHTNESS, not WARMTH. During sunset, lights get brighter but NOT warmer/yellower, defeating the "golden hour" sunset aesthetic.

**Real-World Scenario**:
```
5:30 PM: Dark cloudy sunset
Sun elevation: 0° (actual sunset)
Lux: 800 (dark conditions)

Sunset boost: +12% brightness
Warmth adjustment: 0K (unchanged!)

RESULT: Brighter lights but NOT warmer
EXPECTED: Golden, warm sunset glow (like natural sunset light)
```

**Root Cause**:
```python
# coordinator.py:443-444 - brightness only
raw_brightness_boost = (env_boost + sunset_boost + wake_boost + ...)

# coordinator.py:465 - warmth doesn't include sunset
total_warmth = self._warmth_adjustment + self._scene_warmth_offset
```

**Impact**: Sunset on cloudy days feels artificial (bright but not warm)

**Proposed Fix**:
```python
# features/sunset_boost.py - return BOTH brightness and warmth
class SunsetBoostCalculator:
    def calculate_boost(self, current_lux: float) -> tuple[int, int]:
        """Calculate sunset boost for brightness AND warmth.

        Returns:
            (brightness_boost_pct, warmth_offset_kelvin)
        """
        # ... existing brightness calculation ...
        brightness_boost = int(((4 - elevation) / 8 * 25))

        # Add warmth component (make warmer during sunset)
        # Scale from 0K at elevation=4° to -500K at elevation=-4°
        warmth_offset = -int(((4 - elevation) / 8 * 500))

        return (brightness_boost, warmth_offset)

# coordinator.py - apply both components
sunset_brightness, sunset_warmth = self._sunset_boost.calculate_boost(lux)
raw_brightness_boost = (env_boost + sunset_brightness + ...)
total_warmth = (self._warmth_adjustment + self._scene_warmth_offset + sunset_warmth)
```

**Test Coverage**: Sunset boost tests cover brightness, not warmth
**User Workaround**: Manually adjust warmth during sunset (defeats automation)

---

### ISSUE #5: Service Calls Always Temporary (No Persistent Option) 🚨

**Severity**: MEDIUM - Blocks automation use cases
**File**: `services.py` lines 130, 152

**Problem Description**:
ALL service calls set `start_timers=True`, meaning they're always temporary (2-hour expiry). Users can't create persistent adjustments via automations.

**Real-World Scenario**:
```
Automation: "When I arrive home after work, set brightness to +20%"
Action: Call service adaptive_lighting_pro.adjust_brightness with value=20

6:00 PM: Arrive home, automation runs, +20% applied
         Timer starts (2 hours)
8:00 PM: Timer expires, brightness resets to 0%
         PROBLEM: I wanted persistent +20% based on my daily schedule!
```

**Comparison**:
- Button press: `start_timers=True` ✓ (temporary override - correct)
- Slider drag: `start_timers=False` ✓ (persistent preference - correct)
- Service call: `start_timers=True` ✗ (ALWAYS temporary - wrong!)

**Impact**: Automation-based adjustments unexpectedly expire

**Proposed Fix**:
```yaml
# Add optional 'temporary' parameter to services
service: adaptive_lighting_pro.adjust_brightness
data:
  value: 20
  temporary: false  # Don't start timer (persistent until manually changed)

# services.py
ADJUST_BRIGHTNESS_SCHEMA = vol.Schema({
    vol.Required("value"): vol.All(vol.Coerce(int), vol.Range(min=-100, max=100)),
    vol.Optional("temporary", default=True): cv.boolean,  # Default to current behavior
})

async def handle_adjust_brightness(call: ServiceCall) -> None:
    value = call.data["value"]
    temporary = call.data.get("temporary", True)
    await coordinator.set_brightness_adjustment(value, start_timers=temporary)
```

**Test Coverage**: Service tests don't validate timer behavior
**User Workaround**: Use number entity sliders instead of services (not ideal)

---

### ISSUE #6: Scene Timer Behavior Undefined 🟡

**Severity**: LOW - Design clarification needed
**File**: `services.py` line 282, `coordinator.py` line 1355

**Problem Description**:
Scenes do NOT start timers (unlike manual adjustments), meaning they persist indefinitely. It's unclear if this is intentional.

**Real-World Scenario**:
```
8:00 PM: Apply "Ultra Dim" scene via service
         Scene offsets: -30% brightness, +600K warmth
         NO timer started

10:00 PM: Still in ultra dim (correct for long movie)
2:00 AM: STILL in ultra dim (problem - forgot to clear scene)
Next morning: Bedroom lights ultra dim (very wrong!)
```

**Comparison**:
- Manual adjustment service → Starts 2-hour timer (temporary)
- Scene service → NO timer (persistent)

**Design Questions**:
1. Should scenes expire after timeout (like manual adjustments)?
2. Should scenes persist until manually changed (current behavior)?
3. Should this be configurable per-scene or per-call?

**Impact**: Scenes can "stick" and affect next day if user forgets to clear

**Proposed Options**:
```python
# Option A: Scenes should have timers (consistent with manual adjustments)
await coordinator.apply_scene(scene)
for zone_id in coordinator.zones:
    await coordinator.start_manual_timer(zone_id)

# Option B: Add 'temporary' parameter to scene service (like brightness)
service: adaptive_lighting_pro.apply_scene
data:
  scene: ultra_dim
  temporary: true  # Start timer, expires after 2 hours

# Option C: Per-scene defaults in SCENE_CONFIGS
SCENE_CONFIGS = {
    Scene.ULTRA_DIM: {
        "temporary": True,  # Movie mode - should expire
        ...
    },
    Scene.EVENING_COMFORT: {
        "temporary": False,  # Evening routine - persist until bedtime
        ...
    },
}
```

**Test Coverage**: Scene tests don't validate timer behavior
**User Workaround**: Remember to manually clear scenes (error-prone)

---

### ISSUE #7: SCENE_CONFIGS Contains User-Specific Entities 🔴

**Severity**: CRITICAL (for multi-user) - Blocks HACS submission
**File**: `const.py` SCENE_CONFIGS (need to read full section)
**Status**: DOCUMENTED in KNOWN_ISSUES.md Issue #2

**Problem Description**:
SCENE_CONFIGS in const.py contains specific light entities from developer's home. Works perfectly for single-user testing but blocks multi-user deployment.

**Impact**:
- ✓ Integration works perfectly for developer
- ✗ Other users don't have these entities
- ✗ Blocks HACS submission

**Resolution**: Documented in KNOWN_ISSUES.md, fix required before HACS

---

## 🟡 DESIGN CLARIFICATIONS NEEDED

### Design Question #1: Smart Timeout Calculation

**Context**: implementation_1.yaml had smart timeout (1.5x at night, 1.0x daytime)
**Question**: Should Python integration implement this?

**Benefits**:
- Evening adjustments last through bedtime (3 hours vs 2)
- Daytime adjustments expire faster (more responsive)

**Implementation**:
```python
# features/zone_manager.py
def calculate_smart_timeout(self, base_duration: int) -> int:
    hour = dt_util.now().hour
    multiplier = 1.0

    if 22 <= hour or hour <= 6:  # Night
        multiplier = 1.5

    return int(base_duration * multiplier)
```

**Decision Needed**: Implement smart timeout? (Recommended: YES)

---

### Design Question #2: Wake Sequence Manual Control Interaction

**Options**:
A. Wake sequence OVERRIDES manual control (user can't prevent ramp)
B. Wake sequence only affects lights that are OFF
C. Wake sequence respects manual control (current broken behavior)

**Recommendation**: Option A (override) - wake alarm is intentional, should always work

---

### Design Question #3: Default Timer Behavior Philosophy

**Current State**:
- Buttons: Temporary (2-hour timer)
- Sliders: Persistent (no timer)
- Services: Temporary (2-hour timer)
- Scenes: Persistent (no timer)

**Questions**:
1. Should ALL user actions have timers for consistency?
2. Should persistent vs temporary be user-configurable?
3. Should different action types have different defaults?

**Recommendation**: Make it configurable with sensible defaults:
- Buttons/Services: Temporary by default (override parameter available)
- Sliders: Persistent by default
- Scenes: Configurable per-scene

---

### Design Question #4: Environmental Boost Suppression at Night

**Current**: Night (10 PM - 6 AM) has 0x multiplier (completely disabled)
**Question**: Is this correct? Or should it be reduced (0.3x)?

**Scenario**: 3:00 AM, power outage, lights come back on, it's pitch black
- Current: 0% environmental boost (lights at default brightness)
- Alternative: 30% environmental boost (lights compensate for darkness)

**Recommendation**: Keep 0x - at night, indoor lighting is intentional

---

## 🟢 ENHANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES

### Enhancement #1: Per-Zone Environmental Flags

**Current**: Global environmental boost applied to all zones
**Opportunity**: Per-zone enable/disable (kitchen might not need env boost)

**Implementation**: Already in config schema! Just needs testing:
```python
zone_config.get("environmental_enabled", True)
zone_config.get("sunset_enabled", True)
```

---

### Enhancement #2: Gradual Timer Expiry

**Current**: Timer expires, adjustments snap to 0% instantly
**Opportunity**: Fade out over 5 minutes for smooth transition

**Benefits**: No jarring lighting changes when timer expires

---

### Enhancement #3: Wake Sequence Weekday/Weekend Schedule

**Current**: Wake sequence uses Sonos alarm (always manual)
**Opportunity**: Built-in scheduler with weekday/weekend profiles

**Example**:
```yaml
wake_sequence:
  weekday_alarm: "06:30"
  weekend_alarm: "08:00"
```

---

### Enhancement #4: Scene Transition Speed Configuration

**Current**: All transitions hardcoded to 1 second
**Opportunity**: Per-scene transition speeds

**Example**:
```python
SCENE_CONFIGS = {
    Scene.ULTRA_DIM: {
        "transition_seconds": 3,  # Slow fade for movie mode
    },
    Scene.ALL_LIGHTS: {
        "transition_seconds": 0,  # Instant for cleaning
    },
}
```

---

### Enhancement #5: Manual Control "Lock" Mode

**Current**: All manual adjustments expire (or never expire)
**Opportunity**: Lock toggle to freeze adjustments

**UI**: Show padlock icon when adjustment is locked

---

### Enhancement #6: Health Score Threshold Notifications

**Current**: Health score calculated but not acted upon
**Opportunity**: Persistent notification when health < 70

**Example**: "Adaptive Lighting: 2 switches unavailable, 1 zone has no lights"
