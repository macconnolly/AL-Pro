## 🚀 Quick Start (For Users)

### Installation

**Method 1: Manual Installation**
```bash
cd /config  # Your Home Assistant config directory
mkdir -p custom_components
cd custom_components
git clone https://github.com/macconnolly/AL-Pro.git adaptive_lighting_pro
```

**Method 2: HACS (Future)**

### Setup

1. **Restart Home Assistant** after installation
2. **Add Integration**:
   - Go to Settings → Devices & Services
   - Click "+ Add Integration"
   - Search for "Adaptive Lighting Pro"
3. **Configure Zones** through the UI:
   - Define your 5 lighting zones
   - Assign lights to each zone
   - Set brightness/color temp ranges
   - Configure optional features (Sonos, Zen32)
4. **Entities appear automatically**:
   - 16 sensors for monitoring
   - 6 buttons for quick adjustments
   - 4 number inputs for fine control
   - 1 switch for global pause
   - 1 select for scene control

### What Works Right Now

**✅ Core Lighting Control**

- Asymmetric boundary logic (prevents min/max conflicts)
- Per-zone manual control timers
- Global pause switch

**✅ Environmental Features**
- Lux-based brightness boost (logarithmic curve)
- Weather-aware adjustments (13 weather conditions mapped)
- Seasonal modifiers (winter +8%, summer -3%)
- Time-of-day conditional logic

**✅ Physical Integrations**
- Sonos wake sequences (progressive 15-min ramp before alarm)
- Zen32 scene controller (debounced button mapping)

**✅ Monitoring & Status**
- Real-time status sensors (16 total)
- Environmental boost tracking
- Sunset boost tracking
- Manual control state per zone
- Health monitoring sensors

**✅ Automation Support**
- 10 services for advanced automation
- Scene system (4 predefined scenes)
- Service calls for brightness/warmth adjustment
- Event firing for external consumers

**⚠️ Known Issues**
- Scene layering has bugs (scenes may not combine properly with manual adjustments)
- Timer expiry doesn't clear adjustments as designed
- Startup validation can be flaky
- Sunset boost has edge case calculation errors

### Implementation Workflow

```bash
# 1. Read the context
cat claude.md          # Understand the mission and architecture

# 2. Check the plan
cat PROJECT_PLAN.md    # Review phase you're working on

# 3. Find your task
cat TODO.md            # Identify next unchecked task

# 4. Reference source
# When porting logic, cite line numbers from implementation_1.yaml
# Example: "Porting asymmetric boundary logic from implementation_1.yaml:1845-1881"

# 5. Implement with discipline
# - Follow naming conventions in claude.md

## 🎯 Project Mission

Transform a 3,200-line YAML package into a production-grade Home Assistant custom integration that:

1. ✅ Preserves 100% of original functionality
2. ✅ Fixes all identified bugs and dead code
3. ✅ Adds high-value features (config flow, migration tool, diagnostics)
4. ✅ Provides superior UX through native HA patterns
5. ✅ Enables extensibility through services and blueprints

## 🏗️ Architecture at a Glance

### Coordinator-Centric Design
- **Single DataUpdateCoordinator** as source of truth
- All entities are views into coordinator state
- 30-second polling interval
- Event-driven updates for real-time feedback

### Key Modules
- `coordinator.py` - Central orchestration engine
- `adjustment_engine.py` - Asymmetric boundary logic (critical!)
- `zone_manager.py` - Per-zone state and timers
- `mode_controller.py` - 8 home mode profiles
- `environmental.py` - Lux/weather/sunset processing

### Platform Support
- **Switch**: Zone switches, global pause
- **Number**: Brightness/warmth adjustments
- **Select**: Home modes, lighting scenes
- **Sensor**: Status, analytics, monitoring
- **Button**: Quick actions (brighter, dimmer, reset)
- **Light**: Virtual zone groups

- Configurable via UI (no YAML editing)

### Manual Override System
- Fixed increment controls (±20% brightness, ±500K color temp)

- Seasonal modifiers
- Pre-sunset progressive dimming

### Home Modes (8 Modes)
- Default, Work, Late Night, Movie

- Automatic timer management

### Physical Control
- **Zen32 Scene Controller** integration
- **Sonos Alarm** sunrise synchronization
- **4 Lighting Scenes** with one-button activation

### Comprehensive Monitoring
- 18+ sensors for status and analytics
- Event-driven real-time updates
- Dashboard-ready attributes

## 🎓 For AI Assistants

If you're an AI assistant working on this project:

**MANDATORY CHECKLIST** before implementing:
- [ ] Read [claude.md](claude.md) in full
- [ ] Review relevant sections of [PROJECT_PLAN.md](PROJECT_PLAN.md)
- [ ] Check [TODO.md](TODO.md) for current phase/task
- [ ] Understand the asymmetric boundary logic (it's critical!)
- [ ] Follow naming conventions: `alp_*` for entities, `adaptive_lighting_pro.*` for services

**Non-Negotiable Rules**:
- ✅ Cite line numbers when referencing YAML
- ✅ Write comprehensive docstrings and type hints
- ✅ Add unit tests for all logic
- ✅ Update [TODO.md](TODO.md) when completing tasks
- ❌ NEVER skip phases or implement out of order
- ❌ NEVER contradict architectural decisions in [claude.md](claude.md)
- ❌ NEVER add undocumented features
